# KingFifer40's Clean Memes Bot
This is my Bot's code that I use in a Groupme group called "Clean Memes". It uses an account token, so in order to use it, you need to go to dev.groupme.com and get the token and place it in there. You also need to find the id of the group/topic you will put it in, and place it in the config on top. I will continually update it and potentially add more features.
